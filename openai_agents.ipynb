      "1. **Warmer Temperatures Increase Heatwaves:** As the planet warms, heatwaves become more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting. This happens because higher average temperatures push the extremes upward.\n",

      "2. **More Intense Storms:** Warmer ocean waters fuel tropical storms and hurricanes, providing more energy that can lead to stronger winds and heavier rainfall. This means storms can become more destructive.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Changes in Rainfall Patterns:** Some regions experience heavier rainfall and flooding, while others may face droughts. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, so when it rains, it can pour more intensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Increased Wildfire Risk:** Hotter and drier conditions, influenced by climate change, create ideal environments for wildfires to start and spread.\n",
