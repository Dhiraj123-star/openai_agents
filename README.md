# OpenAI Agents SDK 🤖

A lightweight way to build smart **AI agents** that can reason, use tools, and collaborate.  

---

## 🚀 Core Functionality

- **Create agents** with custom instructions and model settings  
- **Use tools**:  
  - 🔧 Function tools (your own Python functions / APIs)  
  - 🌐 Hosted tools (like web search)  
- **Agents as tools**: let one agent call another while keeping control  
- **Handoffs**: delegate a task entirely to another agent  
- **Structured outputs**: enforce responses in clean formats (e.g. JSON, Pydantic models)  
- **Coordinator flows**: build multi-agent systems where one agent routes work to specialists  

---

## ✅ When to Use

- Automating workflows with multiple steps or APIs  
- Building assistants that can **act** (not just chat)  
- Delegating tasks between specialized agents (e.g. Task Manager, Note Taker)  
- Ensuring **consistent, typed data** from AI responses
